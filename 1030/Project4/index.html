  	<h1>Project 4</h1>
 <a href="http://sparky.j43.ca/Project4/Project1/index.html">Part 1</a>
 
<p>This section was primarily using CSS to tidy up a GPS dashboard , using Media query to give different values to the selectors by changings its float and margin-left values to change its appearance. I added a background image, kept the indicator to red, some colors for the text and an icon for each of the navs.

  <p>This section is making a Tracking Dashboard that had 4 column size for the tabs in desktop size and 12 column in mobile size. It should also be clickable to appear only what is in that tab. Etc when I click Live Map only the map should be shown. So data toggle is something that I learned from this exercise to be able to show only what I click. Nav nav-tabs and tab-pane fade in active is what I used in order to toggle my date to be shown or not shown. Also learned about Bootstrap's grid system and how to make each section a certain size.</p>

     <p>I used a template online  <a href="http://www.bootstrapzero.com/bootstrap-template/cardio-one-page-template">(Cardio template)</a> to start off. I started removing alot of sections to fit the criteria of 3 sections. Went online to replace most of the images. Changed some text to display videos instead. Changed when the images gets highlighted another image appears. Also made a small toggling of the sections to they can hide/show using jquery.  Also changed the column width of the section so the videos fit one row. The main thing from this section that I learned was the use of Jquery to toggle the display style of a section on a webpage.</p>
	 
 <p> From this project I learned how to use Boostrap to create a website of various column sizes, style it up with CSS and use Jquery to handle events for the webpage.</p>
