Critiquing: Nguyen Dong Nghi Phan

Plain design that highlights different locations with a short synopsis of what each area is like. 

Similar design leads to ease of creating within the Css and Html.

Flow is great as it leads to each page with easy clickable links. 

Not as interactive with the users or doesn't pull them in as the website needs more atmosphere. 

The text may need to be wrapped as it extends to the entire width which looks pretty awful.  

Rename content on the bottom to something more descriptive.
