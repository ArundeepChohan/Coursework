My main theme is Starcraft primarily the interactions between the two Factions: Terran and the Zerg. One is a human group while the other are aliens. From the start I used some audio to achieve a pleasant easy going feel for how when Terrans lived peacefully without the Zerg which then transitions into a more serious tone after a Zergling rush. The video shows just how ruthless the Zerg can be.
